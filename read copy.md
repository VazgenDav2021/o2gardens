Look I think that I missed a lot of thinks in types. I will tell you about this app for more context



1. There are restaurant with 3 different halls
2. Each hall has it's own schema of tables, scene if each date, it can be range, it can be for only one day(we can use it as range as well)
3. At the same time in each hall there can be event like, Dj day, Fotball day, etc which is created by Admin
4. Create new type2.ts and place there default minimal types and after it we will dissucss it proper
